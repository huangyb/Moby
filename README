				self.cf2.childImage(disk("sdcard-1g.img"))
				# default to an IDE controller rather than a CF one
				# assuming we've got one

				try:
					self.realview.ide.disks = [self.cf0, self.cf2]
					#self.realview.ide.disks = [self.cf0]
				except:
					self.realview.cf_ctrl.disks = [self.cf0, self.cf2]
